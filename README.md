### Project Overview
---
As the main data analyst for Just In Time, I will analyze supply chain inefficiencies through univariate and bivariate EDA of over 30,000 order records of the company during 2015 - 2017 period , define the key problem through SCQ Framework, identify root causes using diagnostic based tree and hypothesis testing techniques using Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc) to  and propose structural business improvements.

### Data Sources
---
The project is conducted using the data source created and copyrighted by ***Maven Analytics***.

### Tools
---
* MS-Excel - Data Cleaning
* ER Assistant, MySQL Workbench - Data Modeling
* Python - Data Processing and Analytics

### Methods
---
1. Conduct univariate and bivariate EDA to understand the data, explore outliers and variable relationships.
2. Formulate project questions using Situation - Complication - Question (SCQ) framework to identify supply chain problems appropriated to business context.
3. Identify root causes of the problem using diagnostic based tree to formulate key hypotheses.
4. Test hypotheses through data analytics using Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, etc.

### Data Cleansing/Prepartion
---
1. Drop unnecessary columns (Order Timestamp)
2. Appropriate the data types of columns
3. Check for missing, duplicated values
4. Drop records where shipment dates are before order dates.
5. Drop records where profit is larger than net sales (gross sales - discount)
6. After checking for unqiue values of product names in both ***order*** and ***inventory*** tables, there are 113 products being ordered but 118 products being stocked in inventory. Therefore, I expand the initial 3 raw tables into 6 dimensional tables and 1 fact tables as follows:
* Dimensional tables: product, geo, fulfillment, inventory, shipmode, warehouse
* Fact table: order

### Data Modeling
---
1. Create ER Diagram using ER Assistant to investigate consistency, and completeness errors of the relationships, cardinalities, entities, and respective attributes.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Questions:
**Fulfillment Efficiency**
1. What is the average time it takes to fulfill an order (Order Fulfillment Cycle Time)?
2. What percentage of orders are shipped on time (On-Time Shipping Percentage)?

**Sales**
1. Which product depts, order ranges generate the most revenue and profit?
2. What is the overall sales growth rate and profit margin trend over time? Are there seasonal patterns?
3. How do discounts impact sales volume and profitability?
4. What is the relationship between supply chain costs and sales revenue (Inventory-to-Sales Ratio)?
   
**Inventory Optimization**
1. What is the total order quantity? total stock in inventory?
2. Which Top 10 product names account for the most and the least  order quantity, respectively?
3. Which Top 10 products account for the most inventory cost?

Finding Summary:
1. The total order quantity, and warehouse inventory of 2017 is 24% and 20% smaller than the average of 2015 and 2016. The majority of orders contain 2-3 order items, contributing to a profit margin of over 0.8. However, there are no order of 5 following products in 3-year period:
* SOLE E35 Elliptical
* Bushnell Pro X7 Jolt Slope Rangefinder
* SOLE E25 Elliptical
* Bowflex SelectTech 1090 Dumbbells
* Dell Laptop
2. Top 3 sales and profitable categories, namely fishing, camping & hiking, and cleate, demonstrate that the company sales stream mainly comes from logistics of outdoors product lines. In constrast, CDs, Men's clothing, Toys contribute to sales the least. Regarding customer regions, sales are focused on Central America, Western Europe, and South America, while Central Asia, and East Africa generate the lowest sales.
3. The company generate the largest profit out of sales in dry season (Feb - June), and bottom down in Oct and Nov (rainy season). We also see that products with high discount rates are deemed to generate more profit margin.
4. Amongst the 4 shipment modes, First class, traditionally the prioritized mode to have goods delivered within 1 business day, has the smallest on-time shipment percentage, at around 2%, followed with the second class with only 37%. In overall, the average on-time shipment percentage of 4 shipment modes from 2015 - 2017 is only 52%, pretty low compared to normal level at other logistics companies. Specifically, technology, footwear, and pet shop have notably high late shipment rates above 38%.

### Problem and Root Cause Identification
---
#### SCQ
| SCQ Framework  | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Situation  | The company annually performs well from Jan - June, where the most profits and sales come from the logistics of outdoors product categories (fishing, camping & hiking, and cleats) with the order quantity of 2-3 items and large discount rates.  |
| Complication  | The company sees a deep decline in order sales growth rate and profit margin during the Aug - Dec Period in 2017, with unsold products accounting for the majority of inventory cost, and high delayed shipment rates among the prioritized first-class and high-quantity second-class shipping modes. |
| Question  | What are drivers behind Just-In-Time deep decline of sales from Aug to Dec 2017? How can Just-In-Time recover its sales volume to 200,000 USD over the next 1 year? |

#### Diagnostic Based Tree
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b4f4b9-1891-4526-adbf-72b0a6fb28c7)

Hypotheses:
1) Customers change their product preferences while the company does not respond quickly to demand conversion, leading to less orders being made.	
2) The more delayed the shipments in regard of delivery modes, the lesser the number of orders.
3) Suppliers do not provide sufficient products for the company to fulfill the orders.
4) Increasing discount rate decreases the business profit.  	
5) There are products with high-quantity inventory or/and high inventor cost per unit but are not sellable.

### Hypothesis Testing
---
**H1: Customers change their product preferences while the company does not respond quickly to demand conversion, leading to less orders being made.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35599ff-2296-4b47-955d-2fb67cb77c3e)
Comment:
* There is a sharp decrease of around 1,200 orders (82%) from Sep to Oct 2017, and is maintained at around 250 monthly orders for the rest of the period.
* These are 5 products that are not of customer preferences. Despite slight increase of inventory for each of 5 above products, there are less or no change of orders being made for those. 
* However, the order quantity of these products are two low to demonstrate that customers have changed their overall preferences.
=> Therefore, the (H1) hypothesis that company does not respond quickly to change in customers' preference ***is rejected.***

**H2: The more delayed the shipments in regard of delivery modes, the lesser the number of orders.**

Comment:
* Even though the on-time shipping rate of first-class shipment mode is very low, at 2%, there is no correlation between late shipment and the number of orders. 
* We can clearly see that the higher the late shipment rate in regards of second-class shipment rate, the lower the number of orders being made.
=> Therefore, H2 is **partially accepted** when refers to second-class shipment mode only.

**H3: Suppliers do not provide sufficient products for the company to fulfill the orders**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a743f7-9857-4785-a0ec-132c09329a8b)
Coment:
* There is a positive correlation between warehouse inventory and oder quantity. Also, both exert the same trends from 2015 - 2017.
* We can conclude that our loss of orders is consituted by the insufficiency of product supplies.
=> H3 is **supported**

**H4: Increasing discount rate will generate less profit**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d4855e9-a52e-4b29-9dad-b397fcc82848)
**Comment:**
* As company giving high discount rate for their service, they can generate more profit on each service given.
* When certain products in the inventory become obsolete or slow-moving, the company can issue high discount rate for these products to enhance their sales volume, thereby increasing the profit.
=> H4 is **not supported.**

**H5: There are products with high-quantity inventory or/and high inventory cost per unit but are not sellable.**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bf56a8d-2a91-4c61-8dbf-a69ddf0123ab)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1cf481e-7551-4324-a408-cd61accf6329)

Comment: There are 4 products that are unsellable. More importantly, 2 of them accounts for the majority of inventory costs from 2015 - 2017. 
=> H5 is **accepted**.

**Hypothesis Testing Result Summary**
| Hypothesis | Result |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| H1: Customers change their product preferences while the company does not respond quickly to demand conversion, leading to less orders being made.  | Not supported  |
| H2: The more delayed the shipments in regard of delivery modes, the lesser the number of orders. | Partially supported (second-class mode) |
| H3: Suppliers do not provide sufficient products for the company to fulfill the orders  | Supported |
| H4: Increasing discount rate will generate less profit | Not supported |
| H5: There are products with high-quantity inventory or/and high inventory cost per unit but are not sellable. | Supported |

### Recommendations
---
1) To reduce storage cost, the company should increase discount rates for 2-3 order item purchases which target 4 obsolete-inventory products, focusing on Bowflex SelectTech 1090 Dumbbells, and Bushnell Pro X7 Jolt Slope Rangefinder. In the long term, company must keep track of stock turn to define slow-moving or obsolete inventory to prevent accummulation of storage cost through strategic promotion.		
2) The company should validate all product suppliers prospect to identify potential long-term partners versus suppliers who do not provide stock on time. The company might consider terminating contracts with providers with short-fall supplies, if possible, and targeting new reputative suppliers that provide historically profitable products 		
3) Customer satisfaction should be improved to retain customer loyalty and generate new order by reducing late shipments for first-class and second-class mode, in which 60% of budget should be utilized to improve shipment service for second class.		
4) The company should depriorize testing demand by increasing stock for low-ordered products since they are not customers' product preferences, helping reduce a portion of storage cost.

                 
| I       | The first gap and opportunities that we would like to test out is actually about improving the connection and network between visual arts sector and the other adjacent sector to stimulate some kind of cross industry collaboration for more business opportunities. So being a gallery owner, yourself, a founder, what do you think about cross collaborating with, say, the hospitality sector? So for example, the business owners there can purchase art from you to decorate their venue, like hotels, restaurants, or cafes. At the same time, hospitality businesses can also serve as an avenue for sales of your artwork. So they can actually help you to sell to, or attract their patrons, organize certain artist meet and greets, or even use QR codes to explain more about the artwork, and some merchandising related to the artwork. What do you think about that? |
| R       | I have limited resources as a gallery. So I see limited value in something like this, not zero, but limited. I can do some form of promotion, get the concierge to know where the galleries are, and try and push it on that sector. But I think, yeah, that would be helpful. In the gallery's third year, we had four or five times the "concierge disaster" where they asked if so-and-so could come around. We tried putting brochures in hotels 20 years ago, which had limited value. So yes, this is not our top priority. But yes, there is some value there. What we could do in Singapore is get STB and other agencies to promote Singapore as a center for the arts, and it actually is. There are perhaps two or three days worth of museums and galleries in Singapore, from antiquities to modern to contemporary. Three solid days is enough. We probably have some of the best museums in the region, but that's hardly noticed or promoted by the |
| I       | If I may ask you, when you mentioned limited resources, what kind of resources do you mean? You mean manpower? |
| R       | Manpower, manpower. In my mind, I have a certain amount of time, money, and resources to spend. So it's basically a combination of everything, including manpower, right? |
| I       | Sorry, Christian from National Arts Council is waiting in the lobby, so I'll let him join the call. That's Christian from NAC. We can carry on. We were talking about limited resources, money, time, and your time, and you felt you would rather spend your money, time, and effort somewhere else? |
| R       | Yes, not that this idea of hotels and stuff is zero value. I would say it'd be better if Singapore had a general initiative to push this place as a place of the arts, rather than people coming here and then discovering it incidentally. For example, I just came back from London. One of the biggest attractions is the museum. Everyone knows it's the Museum of Music. London could be symbolized by its museums. We've done hardly anything. If I may be more aggressive, the institutes, the museums, are pretty much useless in promoting their activities. Look, they just had 'lava' next door, although none of them were filmed by footballers, which would have increased viewership tenfold. You can translate that into an international viewpoint where people come to Singapore looking for the arts. We have spent a lot of money on |
| I       | When you say "in the region," do you mean Southeast Asia or Asia? |
| R       | Southeast Asia, and perhaps even Asia. We don't have a lot of Asian art from around the world, but we focus on Southeast Asia, a very good focus, and we need to build that. We have hardly touched on it. |
| I       | You mentioned STB promoting two to three tourist days to visit museums. How would that help increase your revenue as a gallery? How do you draw the link? |
| R       | Basically, perhaps 1%-2% might end up being interested. For me, that's good enough, maybe 5% or whatever. But we need to create an opinion or image that Singapore is the place to look at and transact Southeast Asian art. Even if it's just mentioned in guidebooks like places in Thailand, some people might discover it. The word will spread, and the respect for Southeast Asian art increases. When that happens, collectors start to look. |
| I       | So they make a name for it. What about gaming? Like collaboration of art pieces with gaming companies, or gamification of art exhibitions for immersive digital experience? |
| R       | What do you think gaming is? Can you be more specific? For my generation, game is football games. |
| I       | I meant video games, phone games. |
| R       | I personally might be very negative, but I see very little time for that. It's a distraction. |
| I       | It's a distraction. |
| R       | Yes, bad news, possibly. Let's say, for example, if I had a neighbor who sells wine at an opening, and people come over and they just go for the wine. So, for the game, for the gaming, it's quite a distraction. |
| I       | It's not about appreciating the art, it's something else. |
| R       | It's something else. It's negative. |
| I       | I understand. So it seems like collaboration with the tour industry interests you a lot more. When we talk about the tour industry, we actually |
| I       | talk about not only hospitality but also F&B. What do you think about collaborating with Michelin star restaurants, high-end restaurants? They would probably get a cut first. |
| R       | This goes back to my earlier experience with a Michelin restaurant, where I put my artwork. This was 30 years ago. I got zero sales, absolutely zero. People go there to eat, drink, be merry. They hardly appreciate your artwork, and then they are off. That was my experience. There are some venues popping up where art is part of the occasion, and they do manage to sell, I think so. But putting up art in a restaurant is basically doing the restaurant a favor without them paying any rental. |
| I       | But why did that restaurant actually hire a curator to design, explain, and bring stories to put together a story while dining? |
| R       | This goes into what I mentioned earlier, that there are places like clubs that might do something like that. For restaurants, they have their own bottom line. Paying a curator $2,000 to $5,000 wouldn't be worth it for them. Also, if the food is good, people will go there no matter what's on the wall. That's just an opinion. |
| I       | No problem. And then, what about collaboration with high-end luxury merchandisers? Like MBS, LVMH, having exhibitions there? |
| R       | This Gajah Gallery catalogue, for example, has advertisers from Prada, whatever. It's quite painstaking to produce. It's an extra, in the sense that you need a lot of money. Something like this publication might cost $100,000, but they get sponsors. That's one form of cooperation. Art fairs nowadays try to keep art separate from things like jewels. I think the market for art is different compared to jewelry. We are in the business of cultivating collectors, and we have a big handicap in Southeast Asia because there's no regard for Southeast Asian art history. Only recently are they starting undergraduate courses in Southeast Asian art history. It's a bottom-up approach, and results will take 5 to 15 years. We need more respect for art from the region. We also need good, valuable writers in newspapers and publications to write about art meaningfully, not just reporting sales prices. Paying writers is also important, but sometimes galleries don't have a budget for that. Having a budget for writing is helpful. |
| I       | And these writers need to have a good appreciation of the art, right? |
| R       | Yes, and yes, you're right. But again, if you think about the fact that you don't have an undergraduate history program, those fellows are going to be very rare. It's quite shocking. I've been harping on this point for almost 5-10 years now. You won't see the results immediately. It will come very slowly. But if you want to fix the problem, that would be one way to do it slowly and gradually. |
| I       | Understood. Since you're talking about talent, we identified a challenge that everyone says there's a lack of patrons, consumers, and talents. What do you think of an online, centralized talent repository platform, like LinkedIn? Are you familiar with LinkedIn? |
| R       | Yes, I am. |
| I       | A platform like LinkedIn where artists can put up their portfolio. Then patrons or interested people would know where to find them. That would also include your writers. |
| R       | When collectors go direct to artists, it becomes more difficult for galleries. The middleman is cut out. But without that, artists are at the mercy of unprofessional or lazy galleries, unless they get a good one. Artists need help, and galleries also need help to connect the dots. |
| I       | Understand from that perspective. Based on your experience, how do you typically approach a buyer or a talent, like an artist? How do you do that? |
| R       | The world is quite small. We have people who recommend artists, or we observe artists and ask if they'd like to work with us. Then we invite collectors over. They hear about us, meet us at art fairs, etc. We build bonds, and they like our artists and start to recognize the gallery. |
| I       | Just now you mentioned the platform might cut out the middleman. What if the platform is only for galleries? It would be convenient for you to find artists or manage portfolios. Would that be more favorable? |
| R       | It's always good to have a repository or area with huge artists portfolios, where everyone can go. It would be helpful if there's a consolidation of artists. |
| I       | What kind of features would you be looking for? Portfolio, profile, reviews, ratings from other galleries, something like a job posting? |
| R       | Keep it pretty simple and straightforward. Once you see a review, once you see... I don't know if I understood you right, but it could turn out to be a mess with competing galleries and stuff. But yes, keep |
| R       | it simple. Have images, reviews by critics (favorable ones), biography. That should be fine. |
| I       | Having a direct messaging feature to communicate and negotiate terms? Would that be useful? |
| R       | No, those are private things. It's like a contract. You don't want your contract to be public. |
| I       | Would it be helpful if there's optional assistance, a platform middleman, to manage things for you, since you're busy, or you think you can handle that yourself as a priority? |
| R       | The decision to work with an artist is mainly taken by me, but I also listen to my team. We realize it's important to have that, but the team will eventually work with the artist. |
| I       | What possible reservations do you have about this system being rolled out? Concerns we should address if we pilot it? |
| R       | Sorry, you're talking about a platform where artists can be approached? |
| I       | Yes, by galleries themselves. |
| R       | That's fine. It's always good. A directory for Singapore artists who want to be there. They can put their names and images. That's fine. But it needs to be broken up into segments, because if you have 500 artists – Traditional Chinese art, batik painting, contemporary – you need to curate the site so people can find what they're looking for quickly. |
| I       | More filtering then. Any other reservations? Security, safety, cyber scams? |
| R       | That's not a platform for sales, just for info. Artists can leave their email or gallery address. That's fine. |
| I       | Okay, sure. So basically, not too many reservations. Moving to the next topic: facilitating stronger connections and knowledge among domestic and international stakeholders through regular networking events. What do you think? Are you aware of any existing networking events? |
| R       | I think at the top of the list is art fairs. |
| I       | Do you find them successful for networking? |
| R       | Art fairs, yes. That's the issue, but they are very expensive. |
| I       | Very expensive. |
| R       | It's a high price to pay. It's a risk, but you can be lucky. |
| I       | Could you elaborate a bit more about the risk? |
| R       | You don't sell. An art fair like Art SG will cost about $100,000 minimum. If you sell nothing, you're out of pocket. $100,000 for most local galleries can set you back three to five months. If you sell well, you've invested well and can expand. Most galleries just aim to create a presence. EDB and NAC could help Singapore galleries exhibit outside the region or widen their scope within Singapore. |
| I       | You mean geographical coverage? |
| R       | Also local. This year, our expenditure is $160,000, which is a big risk for us, but it's what we need to do. Some form of help would be helpful, but I see the difficulties in depth, because every gallery... |
| I       | Hi, I see Christian from NAC raising his hand. I think he has some questions. |
| I       | Hi, I'm Christian from NAC, part of the visual arts team. I wanted to ask when you said you are looking for more help from NAC. Are you talking about new types of grants beyond those already provided, specifically for art fairs? |
| R       | Firstly, I think NAC is providing enough, actually quite generous, and it's highly appreciated. Widening the scope could be more helpful. I hope NAC is careful and looks for meaningful projects. They already do, but maybe they could do it a bit more. |
| I       | So, meaningful projects like art fairs or general exhibitions elsewhere? |
| R       | Art fairs and also in general. |
| I       | Okay. You are aware we have presentation and participation grants from NAC? They cover local exhibitions and art fairs for international art festivals. We also have the marketing and development grant you can consider. |
| R       | We know of that. We've used it a few times. |
| I       | So you're saying maybe have another scheme that focuses more on new galleries? |
| R       | You guys cover a percentage. Maybe that percentage can be increased. |
| I       | Okay, for commercial galleries, yes. Thank you, that's all from me. |
| I       | So you're talking about widening your scope. To help Christian a little bit, perhaps we'd like to understand more, what else can NAC do besides providing budget and money? |
| R       | What NAC can do, though I don't know if it's in their scope, is encourage institutes/museums to market themselves better as Centers of the Arts. If they did, people would come. Tying up exhibitions with events like Art SG is helpful, like major global art fairs where museums time their shows concurrently. Some of our museum staff seem to think they are above this commercial activity and don't need to time their exhibitions with events like Singapore Art Week. They should be aware and time their shows concurrently. It makes Singapore more attractive. We may not have the critical mass of Hong Kong or Indonesia, but we have good organization, and this is an area we can improve and coordinate. |
| I       | Understand. Go ahead, Christian. |
| I       | Yes, I've noted your comment about Singapore Art Museum or NGS being in sync with Singapore Art Week. To clarify, Singapore Art Museum does try to time exhibitions with Art Week, although it's every two years. With Penny's BIANALE, the return show to Singapore will be timed with Art Week. And the year after that will be our own Singapore BIANALE, also timed with Art Week. So I think SAM does try its best to align. For other things like the festival, maybe they don't align. But for Singapore, they try their best. |
| R       | I understand you don't need to put all your eggs in one basket at that time. Are you talking about the return show from the Venice Biennale during Singapore Week? As much as I respect Ruben Pang as a very good artist, in this context, it's a "Mickey Mouse show" you're putting up at a very important time. Sam needs to wake up to this idea. |
| I       | So are you saying it's not a strong show? |
| R       | I wouldn't say that, it would be insulting to Robert Chow, and I respect him as an artist. But Sam needs to up their game. |
| I       | Okay, thank you. So I think moving on, are you able to see my slide? |
| R       | I have "visual arts ecosystem". What slide is this? |
| I       | Okay. Are you able to see a screen? We have a few other opportunities here. We want your thoughts on which might be best to pilot. 1. Tech art (training artists in digital knowledge, e.g., AI, Photoshop, cross-learning). 2. Utilizing public spaces for art (venues for exhibitions, business collaborations). 3. Cultivating art collection/investment culture (cross-collaboration with luxury goods). 4. Promoting art appreciation daily (merchandising, art on everyday items like cups, bags). 5. Preparing graduates (market exposure, internships, mentorship). |
| R       | So what's the question? |
| I       | We have a few opportunities here. We just wanted to hear your views about each of them, or which would spark your interest as something helpful for NAC to pilot as a strategy forward. |
| R       | Can you go one by one, please? |
| I       | Sure. So the first one is about developing tech art: NFT, digital art. |
| R       | NFT digital, I still think that's an idea. It can come back. With enough resources, I would keep it running. We got some cash from NAC for NFT, but sustaining it requires resources I don't have. Digital platforms help us stay online, which is helpful, though limited in reward. Beyond that, doing documentaries (10-15 minute clips) on artists would help, especially local artists, creating 'fame' or status for them, like documentaries on Vincent van Gogh. Documentaries are far-reaching, but they are big budget items and take time and effort, which is a headache for the gallery. What's next? |
| I       | Utilizing public spaces for arts. |
| R       | Sculpture and public art are very important. If you walk around London, you see sculptures of their leaders like Churchill, Wellington, Nelson. In Singapore, we are even scared to put up an LKY sculpture. If you removed Singaporeans and replaced them, they wouldn't know who lived here before. It's sad that we live in fear of our leaders and history. In England, these sculptures remind you of their leadership and vision. Coming back to public spaces for art, yes, it can be helpful. Sales-wise, it could be good. Our gallery is getting into sculpture, and it would be helpful if we can put some important sculptures outside. What's next? |
| I       | Can I jump in? Aside from public spaces for sculpture, what about placing art in luxury boutiques like Louis Vuitton or Cartier, or interior design/furniture shops? You mentioned restaurants didn't help with sales. But if placing art there leads interested buyers back to the gallery, would that be financially helpful? |
| R       | With a furniture shop, most of my artists will kill me if I try and put them there. |
| I       | Why would you say that? |
| R       | Maybe because it's not up to their level. It's fine art with furniture. But with younger artists or students, by all means, go try. It's a starting point. If an artist starts doing that, they build up their portfolio and get sales. But if you're talking about Louis Vuitton or Cartier, yes, I think Cartier or Hermes do special projects with established artists. That's okay, not bad. |
| I       | Aside from less skills, do you think such a platform could provide good publicity for artists, reaching people who don't normally know local artists, maybe those buying watches or furniture? |
| R       | If you just put the thing on the wall and leave it, it's not very good. Hermes actually does an event, an opening. They have some sort of sponsorship for the artists. That's helpful. You just put it on the wall as decoration? Good luck to you. |
| I       | I mean, placing the work as a pretext for sales. |
| R       | I think not. Normally, the salesperson won't be interested. They'd rather the money spent on the watch or handbag. |
| I       | Okay. Thank you so much. |
| I       | Back to Christian's earlier point about luxury brands. The third point is about investment culture through collaboration with high-end brands. If you put an art piece there, and the salesperson gets a commission from the sale, do you think that would incentivize them? |
| R       | Yes. Commissions to consultants work. We're very willing to do that. But again, how it's managed is the detail. If Cartier wants to do a show for one of our artists, fine. They want to put something on their walls? I'll be quite reluctant. For my entry-level artists, I'll do it for them, at least they get a chance. But for my more established artists, I wouldn't do that. |
| I       | Right. Understand. So the fourth one is about promoting art appreciation in everyday life, through merchandising. Mass producing art or art designs on items like cups or tote bags? |
| R       | Yes, that works. But again, it's "Mickey Mouse money", unless the artist makes a good income from projects like this. We do merchandise, which we often give out for free. Some things we have sold |
| R       | before, but these are not for street-popular artists where people wear their T-shirts. That would help for certain artists, I would say. |
| I       | Okay. The last one is about preparing art graduates to collaborate with existing institutes like LaSalle, to provide market exposure for fresh graduates before they enter the workforce. What do you think about that? |
| R       | That's always very good. Until now, we haven't had many LaSalle artists visit or work with us. I think educators don't highlight galleries or inform students about the reality of the art world. They need to be well-informed about what galleries are like. |
| I       | Before I carry on, I see Christian's colleague, Tessa. If I may, I'll allow her to join this conversation. So, what's hindering you from collaborating with the institutes right now? Is it a lack of opportunity? |
| R       | Firstly, they haven't approached me. Secondly, I don't know if I'm qualified to speak to them as an educator, as I speak my mind, which may not always be right. These things take time to prepare. I do have knowledge to share, but how and when to do it is another matter. |
| I       | So I would say that you are open to having them as an intern for your gallery. |
| R       | Of course, we have interns, usually one or two at a time, whom we pay and expose. Many come with limited knowledge, knowing nothing about Southeast Asia or its artists, only Western names. This is a huge error. People don't know the value of regional artists. Few are educated about it. As I said in a committee, the museum director, curators, and even galleries are 'bluffing' because there isn't enough knowledge. There's no undergraduate program, no respect for the artists here. How can you start respectfully? It's limited. We are lucky with the support we have. I think they've started some art history program, which will help, but it will take years to trickle down. |
| I       | Right. Thank you very much. It's about an hour, and I don't want to take up too much of your time. |
| R       | I think you got scared in my last comment. |
| I       | Nola, so I just wanted to open up to the ground. Christian, Tessa, any other questions? |
| I       | Yeah, to deep dive into what the institutions offer. Do you think it would be beneficial for graduating artists or art schools to teach them how to talk to galleries, ensure they get internships, or bring students to excursions to interact with gallery directors? |
| R       | It's very simple. I think five minutes of knowledge. When you go to a gallery, look at the back room. Who is there? Those are the people running the show. See how active the gallery is, if they are just using you as a prop, if they do write-ups or take you to shows. These are the important details about getting value from your gallery. An artist takes home maybe 50%, and a gallery like mine takes home maybe 5% after expenses. Artists need to ensure their money is well spent, that things are being done for them (events, etc.). It would be good to give them a blueprint, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. Recognize that if a young artist sells one $5,000 work a month (entry level), they get $2,000, which is hard to live on. |
| R       | It's very hard, not going to happen quickly. NAC needs to help build up the artist with the right gallery so they can live and focus on their career. Yes, carry on. |
| I       | Yes. Returning to the first opportunity, tech art. You mentioned your gallery dabbled in NFT. What do you think about teaching artists how to use platforms like TikTok to promote themselves, aside from AI or Photoshop skills? Would that benefit artists and the gallery? |
| R       | TikTok is separate. I want to stress the point about AI and that 'stuff'. I think that's a new field which you should emphasize because it's going to be very big. Just focus on that, not TikTok. Usually, if I find an artist on TikTok, it suggests they haven't 'made it'. Artists already in a gallery have prestige. TikTok might spread awareness, but I haven't had a client walk in after doing a TikTok dance and buy a painting. |
| I       | Okay. So more on developing artistic skills with tech? |
| R       | Yes. I would think that would be very good, those avenues. It's a new world that hasn't really encroached on ours in a big way. But artists should be aware of what's happening. If not in their art world, it could help in other jobs. |
| I       | It can also help in cross-collaboration, right? If a trained painter has this additional skill, it might push their practice forward. Do you feel that way? |
| R       | Yes, I suppose it will. NFT might make a comeback. My collectors still prefer traditional media. We sold maybe $10,000 of NFT, which is nothing in the art world. A New York gallery pays an entry-level manager $20,000 US/month plus commission. They can do this because their prices are high. Many artists struggle because people say art is expensive. Any artist selling work under $10,000 is struggling to survive, unless they are photography artists or something different. We need to raise prices. With good prices, at art fairs, you can expose artists, and collectors have the money. The struggle is making them believe the artist is worth it. And that is the big struggle of the gallery. |
| I       | Sorry, which brings back to your point that originally you felt many people don't value or respect Southeast Asian art? |
| R       | Yes, they see us but don't respect us. There's a Western artist... (mentions a story about a cooperative). They were ostracized but are now famous. This reminds me of Suzanne Victor, a Singaporean artist who did art about feminism in the 90s. As a gallery, I feel the burden because SAM (Singapore Art Museum) has collected her work but hasn't given her a solo show, while doing shows for others. This is where institutions aren't stepping up. Curators are busy, but these basic things need to be done. Our institutions are hardly significant regionally. An artist of mine was collected by Tate Modern with amazing commentary. But she was just one of hundreds collected. When SAM collects works, it's not seen as a big deal because they haven't built up that stature. They need to do something to help build that stature, which would be very helpful to us. There's an underlying issue where art is seen as |
| R       | insignificant. Another story: 15 years ago, I met Indonesian collector Alex Papadimitri. He collected 136 Afandi and Hendra works in the 1960s when Indonesia was poor, showing great vision. Like the Romans taking Greek art or the Monuments Men saving art from Nazis, protecting art is vital. It's the soul of the country. I sent tickets to NAC/MCCY people to see 'Monuments Men' to show them the significance. Perhaps it was the wrong way. But it's very important for nation-building; it comes down to art. Unfortunately, our first leader forbade sculptures of himself, so our CBD is full of foreign sculptures (Dali, Craig, Botero), very little local/regional art. How do you know this place belongs to us? When art is at an 'apologetic' level, existing only because people have money to buy, it's difficult for us. We have to build up its importance. As 'Monuments Men' shows, it's more than life and death. |
| R       | I took one part from George Clooney talking about how important this is; if you rob a country of it, there's nothing left. Sorry for the digression, please carry on to the next question. |
| I       | Any questions from Tessa? |
| I       | Hi, none for me. Thank you. |
| I       | Okay. Thank you very much for your insightful session today. Your recommendations are quite insightful. I'd like to share it with the National Arts Council more formally, but I probably wouldn't quote your name. I would just say "a Singapore gallery". Would that work for you? |
| R       | Can. You can quote me, as long as it doesn't affect my funding. |
| I       | I see Christian here shaking his head, so I'm sure it wouldn't affect your funding. |
| R       | If it does, then don't. |
| I       | No, no. I think some of your recommendations are very insightful and would be helpful for the industry, especially those related to tourism. |
| R       | There has to be a balance where the gallery needs to work and create its market. At the extreme end, don't expect Minister Edwin Tong to come here and help me sell my painting. They have to tie their shoelaces. But help is appreciated, and more help would be appreciated. Thank you very much. |
| I       | No problem. Thank you very much. Bye bye. |
